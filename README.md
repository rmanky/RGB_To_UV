# RGB_To_UV
An OBS Shader + Blender File to create 3D Scenes in OBS.

*A warning, it's not perfect. We need to convert an RGB value (between 0-255) to a pixel value (between 0-1920 or 0-1080).*
*The current method uses multiple images in an attempt to reduce pixelation, but some seams can still be seen if inspected closely.*
